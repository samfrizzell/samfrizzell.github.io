I"¸<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Sam Frizzell and Iâ€™m a Japanese language enthusiast. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Asian Studies and Asian Cultures &amp; Languages (i.e. Japanese), but if Iâ€™m honest, I learned more Japanese on my own, through self-study, than I did through my degree.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m very passionate about the idea that with enough enthusiasm, time, and the right tools, you too can learn a language such as Japanese! <em><strong>Yes, you!</strong></em> Iâ€™ll be discussing Japanese mostly, as thatâ€™s my experience, but the techniques I talk about can be applied to other languages as well.</p>

<p>Please take a few minutes to explore my blog, and you may just learn something new!</p>

<h3 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h3>

<p>This site was made with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> in order to prove to myself that I could learn technical skills on my own, and not just language skills. And if it looks impressive to someone else, too, well, thatâ€™s a great bonus!</p>

<p>If you have any questions for me, you can contact me <a href="mailto:intermediatemode@gmail.com">by email</a>.</p>
