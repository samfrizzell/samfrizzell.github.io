*[中級]: ちゅうきゅう
Welcome to my blog, _Intermediate Mode_, or 中級モード.

My name is Sam Frizzell and I enjoy writing about language learning, specifically Japanese, the language I (more or less) taught myself! I still consider myself to be an intermediate level, so this blog will mostly feature posts about getting past that pesky intermediate plateau. Take a look around, or view my [public repository on Github](https://github.com/samfrizzell/samfrizzell.github.io).
