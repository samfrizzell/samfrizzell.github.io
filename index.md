## About Me

<img src="/images/headshot.png" class="float-r" alt="Photo of Sam Frizzell">

I'm a new professional looking to break into the field of technical communication. I graduated from the University of Texas and am currently searching for work in software documentation. I have pursued continuing education from the [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/), and you can see the results of my training on this site.

It is essential for technical communicators to understand both the user and the product, and that's what I intend to do for each project I create. 

## About This Site

I created this site in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. I customized it using VS Code as my editor. The theme is [Edition](https://github.com/CloudCannon/edition-jekyll-template). Find [the repository here](https://github.com/samfrizzell/samfrizzell.github.io).
