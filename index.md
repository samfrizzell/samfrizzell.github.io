## About Me

<img src="/images/headshot.png" class="float-r" alt="Photo of Sam Frizzell">

I'm a new professional looking to break into the field of technical communication. I graduated from the University of Texas and am currently searching for work in software documentation. After graduating, I pursued continuing education from the [Society for Technical Communication](https://www.stc.org/), and you can see the results of that training on this site.

There's nothing more important for technical communicators than understanding both the user and the product, and that's what I intend to do for each project I create.
