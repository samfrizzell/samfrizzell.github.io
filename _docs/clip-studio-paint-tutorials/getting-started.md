2. If opening for the first time, a dialog prompts you to enter your serial number. Do so and press **Register License**. 

> If this dialog does not appear, go to **Help > Review/Change License** on Windows or **Clip Studio Paint > Review/Change License** on macOS.

## First-time setup: pen pressure settings

1. If opening for the first time, a pen pressure wizard dialog appears on startup. Follow the instructions in the dialog to calibrate your pen pressure settings, then press **Check adjusted settings**.
2. In the next dialog box, follow the instructions to check your settings and fine-tune them if necessary. When you are satisfied with the settings, press **Done** to exit the pen pressure wizard.

> If you want to change pen pressure settings again later, go to **File > Pen Pressure Settings**.

## First-time setup: arranging the workspace

Clip Studio Paint allows you to arrange the side panels and palettes by clicking and dragging.

By default, the left sidebar contains:

* Tool Palette
* Sub Tool Palette
* Tool Property Palette
* Brush Size Palette
* Color Wheel Palette

The right sidebar contains:

* Quick Access and Materials Palettes
* Navigator Palette
* Layer Property Palette
* Layer Palette

The bottom of the window contains the minimized Timeline Palette.

You can click and drag the icon for any of these palettes to place them somewhere else on the workstation. After dragging them out of the sidebar, you can minimize them or close them with the icons that appear in the top right corner.

> If you close any of the palettes and want to reopen them later, go to **Window** and select the palette you wish to open.

For more information about palettes, see [Introduction to Clip Studio Paint: Palettes](/clip-studio-paint-tutorials/palettes).

## Command Bar and Launchers

The Command Bar is shown above the canvas. It contains several common actions by default, such as New, Open, and Save. Hover over each button to see what it does. 

If you want to customize the Command Bar, go to **File > Command Bar Settings** on Windows or **Clip Studio Paint > Command Bar Settings** on macOS.

Launchers are shown when certain tools are being used. For example, one shows up when you create a selection:

Launchers contain actions related to the tool being used. For example, the Selection Launcher contains Deselect, Crop, Invert Selected Area, and more. As with the Command Bar and other places in Clip Studio Paint, hover over each button to see what it does.
