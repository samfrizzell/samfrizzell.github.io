## Palettes

Palettes refer to the panes that are, by default, on either side and the bottom of the workspace in Clip Studio Paint. Palettes contain tools you can switch to and use, browsers for materials, settings that control tools and layers, and so on.

As described in [Getting Started in Clip Studio Paint](/clip-studio-paint-tutorials/getting-started), you can rearrange the workspace to your liking. The following image shows the default arrangement of palettes.

To minimize a palette or sidebar to icons, press the arrow above it (or left of it, in the case of the bottom part of the workspace). To fully minimize it, press the double arrow. To expand it, press the arrow again.

### Tool Palettes

After selecting a tool from the Tool Palette, the Sub Tool, Tool Property, and Brush Size Palettes change accordingly. 

* With the Sub Tool Palette, you can change the sub tool. For instance, the Pen tool includes Pen and Marker categories, and several sub tools within each category.<br>

* With the Tool Property Palette, you can change properties of the sub tool. For instance, if the Hard Airbrush sub tool is selected, you can change brush size, blending mode, hardness, and so on. <br>
