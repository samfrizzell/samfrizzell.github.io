This is the first post in a series I'll call _Intriguing Expressions_. As the title suggests, I'll cover expressions in Japanese that are interesting in some way, such as those that don't have direct English equivalents or are multi-purpose. This post is about 勝手(に) _katte(ni)_.

If you've done much reading or listening outside of a textbook, you'll almost certainly have come across the common expression 勝手に: 

* 「勝手にしろ」
* 「勝手なこと言うな」
* 「勝手に使わないで、それ！」

It's often used in rough speech or negative imperatives (commands to _not_ do something). If you look it up in a Japanese-English dictionary, you'll get a definition looking something like this one from [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%8B%9D%E6%89%8B): 

勝手（かって）
: 1. (noun, na-adjective) one's own convenience; one's way; selfishness​
: 2. (noun) surroundings; environment; way of doing things​
: 3. (noun) convenience; ease of use​
: 4. (noun) financial circumstances; living; livelihood​
: 5. (noun) kitchen
: 6. (noun) right hand (in archery); hand that pulls the bowstring​
: 7. (noun, prefix) unauthorised (e.g. phone app, WWW site); unofficial​

That's a lot of definitions! Is this actually a really complex word? I'll leave that for you to decide at the end of this post, but first, let's take a look at the Japanese definition, such as this one from [Goo Dictionary](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%e5%8b%9d%e6%89%8b/).

勝手（かって）
: ［名・形動］
: １ 他人のことはかまわないで、自分だけに都合がよいように振る舞うこと。また、そのさま。「そんな―は許さない」「―なことを言うな」「―に使っては困る」「―にしろ」
: ２ 何かするときの物事のぐあいのよしあし。都合や便利のよいこと。また、そのさま。「この間取りではどうも―が悪い」「使い― (がって) がいい」
: ［名］
: １ 台所。「―仕事」
: ２ 暮らし向き。生計。「―が苦しい」
: ３ 自分がかかわる物事のようす・事情。「仕事の―がわからない」「―が違う」「―知ったる他人の家」
: ４ 弓の弦を引くほうの手。右手。左手より力が勝ちやすいからいう。引き手。

It's also got a helpful usage note differentiating it from 気まま that I won't reproduce here, but is worth reading. Depending on how familiar you are with Japanese dictionaries, this might be quite clear, or it could look like nonsense to you. I plan to do a post at some point on switching to a monolingual dictionary, but until then, I'll help you out here.

Alright, so we're seeing some similar definitions. We notice the "kitchen" definition is in there, as is the archery-related definition, which we'll proceed to ignore, as it's a specialized usage not found in ordinary speech. We also see some examples of usage, given in square quotation marks. 

*[形容動詞]: けいようどうし
If you'll notice, 「また、そのさま」 is in the first two definitions, but not the others. This means, more or less, "Or, the state of being thereof." Much like English dictionaries' "Of or relating to," it's used when describing words that can be either a noun or an adjective. In other words, as it says at the beginning with "[名・形動]", these first two usages are both noun and adjective. (形動 is short for 形容動詞, and refers to an adjectival noun, known by most Japanese learners as a na-adjective.)

Let's examine the first definition.

１ 他人のことはかまわないで、自分だけに都合がよいように振る舞うこと。また、そのさま。

In English, this goes something like, "Acting according to one's own convenience, without regard for others. Or, the state thereof." Pretty straightforward, when explained that way! To use their examples:

「そんな**勝手**は許さない」 = I won't allow that sort of selfish behavior.

「**勝手**なことを言うな」 = Don't say things only for your own convenience (without regard for others).

「**勝手**に使っては困る」 = If you use it for your own selfish needs, I'll be in trouble.

「**勝手**にしろ」 = Whatever. Do what you want.

How about the second definition? 

２ 何かするときの物事のぐあいのよしあし。都合や便利のよいこと。また、そのさま。

To translate the definition: "The good and bad of the condition of things when one is doing something. Something convenient. Or, the state thereof." In other words, the "surroundings; environment" as well as the "convenience; ease of use" of our English definitions. That's still a little vague, so let's look at the examples to understand how this would be used:

「この間取りではどうも**勝手**が悪い」 = With this floor plan, (it) is quite difficult to use/inconvenient.

「使い**勝手**(がって) がいい」 = Easy to use

Now that we understand the first two definitions, the others become easier to understand (besides "kitchen," which was already quite straightforward). 

２ 暮らし向き。生計。"The state of one's livelihood. One's means of making a living."

３ 自分がかかわる物事のようす・事情。 "The condition or circumstances of things surrounding oneself."

So, we can conclude that 勝手 has to do with one's own circumstances, situation, or convenience, and sometimes has a financial connotation, as in the 「生計」 definition. Take a look at the other example definitions and see if they make more sense now. As in English dictionaries, Japanese dictionaries order their definitions from most to least common, so you'll see the first definition most of all. 

Looking back at the [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org) definition, we can see how the meaning of "unauthorized (e.g. phone app, WWW site); unofficial​" could have developed. A website or app made for oneself (and perhaps other fans) regardless of the will of the official company or IP owner could easily be seen as and expressed as 勝手.

What do you think? Was 勝手 as complicated as it seemed at first glance? Since it's not the type of expression you can easily guess from the kanji, and there's no direct English equivalent, it took some explanation, but I think we did a pretty good job of covering the basics of this expression.
