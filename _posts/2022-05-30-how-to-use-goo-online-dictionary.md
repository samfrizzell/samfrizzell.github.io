I plan to make a comprehensive post or series on moving from using Japanese-English dictionaries to Japanese-only (monolingual) dictionaries, of which this post may be a part. Until then, though, let's learn how to navigate [goo Dictionary](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/).

## What is Goo?

Goo (pronounced "グー", like the English word, and stylized lowercase) is an online portal site much like Yahoo Japan, with news and various services and tools, including:

* news
* weather
* maps
* email
* real estate listings
* online shopping
* dictionary
* and more!

I would recommend poking around when you have the time; many of the services may not be too useful if you don't live in Japan, but others, like the [Flower Reference](https://minhana.net/), are informative and helpful no matter where you live.

## The Goo Dictionary Homepage

Start by navigating to the dictionary from the [goo homepage](https://goo.ne.jp) by clicking the "辞書" link under "サービス" or by linking to [the dictionary directly](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/). Here's what the dictionary homepage should look like on desktop:

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_1.png" alt="The Goo Dictionary Homepage"><figcaption>We start off at the dictionary homepage.</figcaption></figure>

We'll ignore the very top bar, although there is a benefit to logging in (ログイン) or creating an account (新規登録) with goo: as it says on the right, you can bookmark up to 200 words. Under that top bar is the logo and search bar, with a drop-down list. The list has the following choices:

* で始まる "begins with" 
* で一致する "exact match"
* で終わる "ends with"
* を説明文に含む "definition contains"
* を見出しに含む "headword (i.e. the word being defined) contains"

Below the search bar is what I assume to be ad space, below which is a series of tabs. Let's go through these as well. (In some cases, the URL of the tab gives you a hint.)

* 辞書 "dictionary": the front page (the one we're on)
* 国語 "national (i.e. Japanese) language": monolingual dictionaries
* 英和・和英 "EN-JA/JA-EN": bilingual dictionaries
* 類語 "synonyms": thesaurus
* 四字熟語 "four-character compounds": information on _yojijukugo_
* 漢字 "kanji": information on _kanji_
* 人名 "people names": information on famous people
* 専門用語 "technical terms": jargon and specialized vocabulary databases
* 豆知識 "trivia": quizzes and columns with articles about words

Below that, in the center/left, are some of the same links again. Note that 小学館 (Shōgakukan), 三省堂 (Sanseidō), and 学研 (Gakken) are publishers from which goo's information is drawn; if you go to the main page for each resource, you can see where the definitions come from specifically.

Then we have updates and announcements (更新情報・お知らせ), rankings for popular/trending words, links to browse by first syllable/letter or by category, and the sitemap. On the right, there's the login buttons, browsing history (閲覧履歴), tweets from the official goo dictionary account, links to some columns, and newly added words (新着ワード).

## Using the Goo Dictionary

What should we look up as an example? Let's try a word with multiple definitions, such as the one we examined the other day, 勝手. Let's type in 勝手 (_katte_), leaving it on "で始まる" for now, and click on the first result, the listing we want.

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_2.png" alt="Search Results for katte"><figcaption>Several results come up when searching for 勝手.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_3.png" alt="Dictionary Entry for katte"><figcaption>The dictionary entry itself, after clicking on the first result, should look something like this.</figcaption></figure>

What do we have here? At the top of the definition is the headword (the word being defined) in bold, in both kanji and hiragana. Next to that is "の意味" or "meaning of...", and above is the categories under which 勝手 can be found. 出典 or "source" indicates which dictionary the entry is drawn from.

We start on the 意味 ("meaning") tab, which contains the headword again and "の解説" ("explanation of..."). Then we have two definition groups with a few actual definitions each. Like in an English dictionary, the entry is divided by usage and part of speech. In this case, group one is listed as "名・形動", which, depending on your familiarity with grammatical terms, you may recognize as short for 名詞 ("noun") and 形容動詞 ("adjectival noun"). Group two is listed simply as "名" for "noun". Each group has a few definitions, which consist of an explanation followed by usage examples given in square quotation marks 「」.

After the definitions themselves is a paragraph marked as "用法", or "rules for usage". This is just what it sounds like: an explanation expanding on the definitions and, in this case, differentiating the listed word, 勝手, from a similar word, 気まま. Underneath that we have "類語" ("similar words") and "関連語" ("related words"), and beneath that, various links to other information, such as the categories for the word, idioms and figures of speech including the word, and example sentences. 

Incidentally, the tabs above the definitions also bring us to "例文" ("example sentences"), "慣用句" ("idioms"), and "画像" ("images", grayed out in this case).

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_4.png" alt="The Lower Portion of the katte Definition Page"><figcaption>Underneath the definitions and usage notes, there are further resources.</figcaption></figure>

Let's try another search. How about a fun four-character compound, like 電光石火 (でんこうせっか, _denkousekka_)? Let's type that in, and...is that three different entries?

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_5.png" alt="Dictionary Entry for denkousekka"><figcaption>Some words, such as 電光石火, show entries from multiple sources.</figcaption></figure>

That's right. If you look at the bolded header of each entry, you can see they are from each of the three dictionary publishers mentioned on the front page: Sanseidō, Gakken, and Shōgakukan. Each entry also has slightly different supplementary information: the first has "出典" ("source"), "句例" ("phrase example"), and "用例" ("usage example"); the second has "類語" ("similar words"); and the third has "「でんこう【電光】」の全ての意味を見る" ("view all meanings of _denkou_", which is the first half of the compound).

So what does 電光石火 mean, anyway? Try reading through the definitions on your own, first, then I'll tell you the answer.

The answer: 電光石火 means "like a flash of lightning (電光) or the spark from hitting a stone (石火), something extremely fast or a very short period of time." If you happen to be familiar with Pokémon, "でんこうせっか" is the Japanese name of the common attack move "Quick Attack," which always (well, almost always) goes first.

One more, you say? Let's look at a kanji. How about one of the trending ones, like 颯? You can find it in your IME by typing さつ or はやて, or copy-and-pasting it from the previous sentence.

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_6.png" alt="The Kanji Dictionary Entry for satsu"><figcaption>The first entry for 颯 has a nice large text size for the kanji itself.</figcaption></figure>

This page has two entries, one from 漢字ペディア ("Kanjipedia") and one from the Shōgakukan dictionary known as 大辞泉 or _Daijisen_. Kanjipedia has a bunch of information for us. Here's what each word means:

* 部首 "radical"
* 画数 "stroke count" and 部首内画数 "stroke count within (i.e. excluding) the radical"
* 種別 "category": this is where it would include "常用漢字" if it were a Common-Use Kanji and "教育漢字" if it were a kanji taught in primary school
* 漢検の級 "Kanken (kanji test) level"
* 音読み "on'yomi": the typically Chinese-derived reading(s) of a kanji
* 訓読み "kun'yomi": the native Japanese reading of a kanji

The Shōgakukan Daijisen has a smaller entry, but still a fair amount of information. First it lists the reading, さつ, and the kanji, 颯. The small "x" means this kanji is not a Common-Use (常用) Kanji—more information on symbols can be found in the [Daijisen's usage guide](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/help/jn/) under "常用漢字". Then it notes that the kanji is a "人名用漢字", or a Name-Use Kanji (a category including rarer characters than 常用漢字). It lists the "音" (short for on'yomi) as サツ, and notes with "慣" that this is a 慣用読み (customary reading), or in other words, an on'yomi not derived from one of the Chinese languages but used by custom. Following that is simply the definitions and examples.

<figure><img src="/images/04/04_7.png" alt="The Lower Section of the Kanji Dictionary Entry for satsu"><figcaption>The Daijisen entry for 颯 has a more condensed format.</figcaption></figure>

Below the two entries are further resources: other kanji with the same number of strokes, other kanji with the same radical, other Kanken Level 1 kanji, and words beginning or ending with the kanji 颯.

## Conclusion

The goo online dictionary is an invaluable resource for intermediate and above Japanese learners. Knowing how to navigate and read a monolingual dictionary can help you study more efficiently and explore more new words. It's a great tool for increasing your vocabulary and reading level.
