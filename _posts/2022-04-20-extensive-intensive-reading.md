If you've spent much time in online language learning spaces, you've probably heard the terms _extensive reading_ and _intensive reading_. What do these terms mean, and how should they be used for self-study?

First, let's define these terms. **Extensive reading**, sometimes known as **ER**, means reading lots of easy material for your reading level, particularly based on your own interests. **Intensive reading**, or **IR**, on the other hand, is traditionally led by an instructor, and involves close analysis and even translation of often difficult material.

These techniques have been studied for various languages around the world and shown to be effective for vocabulary development in particular, which is one of the most important aspects of language acquisition (see [Further Reading](#further-reading)). However, most of these studies are done in a classroom setting, whereas our area of interest is whether these methods are effective for solitary learners. Published research on independent language learners is, as you might imagine, fairly limited in comparison to classroom-based research. But since we're not designing a program for an institution, we're making a plan for a sample size of one (ourselves), this doesn't need to be an exact science. In other words, we can convert these general concepts into strategies to use ourselves and then, as always, adapt where necessary.

That said, what do ER and IR mean for us? Here's my take:

**Extensive reading** is reading what you want, as much as you want, without stopping to look up every unknown word. This isn't to say you allow yourself to get lost, though—I'll explain further in a moment.

**Intensive reading** will be the opposite: you'll look up each word you don't understand until you fully (or to the best of your current ability) understand each sentence of the material.

## Extensive Reading

_Best started:_ at a beginner-intermediate level, or, more accurately, as soon as you can find reading material with which you can use this technique successfully.

_Best material to use:_ any genre will work. The longer the text, the better. Try a mix of fiction and nonfiction in order to see the differences between literary stylings, but don't use anything you have to force yourself to read.

How should you read extensively? The answer is fairly simple—read interesting things, such as what you like reading in your native language. If you don't know where to start, I’d suggest manga (for Japanese learners) or other comic-type media . There are dozens of subgenres targeting a wide range of audiences, and the nature of the medium helps you out: there are pictures! Also, it doesn't hurt to get familiar with the way people speak, even if it can be unrealistic in some manga (I'm looking at you, [unique laughing styles of One Piece](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Laughter_Style)!)

Don't like manga? Don't read it! Try pop nonfiction on a subject you like. You'll learn specialized vocabulary for your hobby or interest, and you may learn something new as well. Like video games? Choose a game with lots of dialogue, and play it in the original language. You could even pick up one you've played before: I learned a ton of interesting verbs from Pokémon. The sky's the limit with extensive reading.

As for methodology, I'd suggest a few general guidelines:

1. **Read extensively.** It's in the name, so it goes without saying. Read a lot, and read a variety of things.
2. **Don't get hung up on searching for each new word.** If it's essential to an important sentence, it appears over and over, or it's just plain bugging you, then by all means, look it up. But if it's none of those, you may be able to skip it and move on. We all have English words we picked up from context and can't quite define, so allow yourself to have this for your target language as well.
3. **Quantity over quality.** Much like in an immersion course, we want as much reading to be happening as possible within the time we have available. Don't purposefully pick up something that's so easy you are yawning (like a low-level graded reader, for instance) but don't worry too much if you're understanding it better than expected. That's the goal, after all!
4. **If it feels like pleasure reading, you're doing it right.** At first, it won't feel like anything but more studying. However, as you get familiar with longer texts, it should become more like leisure time. You don't need to feel guilty when you lose yourself in the content instead of the grammar. Quite the contrary, that means you're enjoying reading in your target language, which is awesome!
5. **Break these guidelines whenever you deem it necessary.** So you get into haiku, and it's short and you have to look up everything. That's fine! The idea here is to add fun into our language learning process, to encourage ourselves to keep going. I don't have any research to back this up—wait, [yes I do](#further-reading)!—but it seems to me that an important, if not _the most_ important, part of extensive reading is its effect on your mood and motivation: its affective effect, if you will. Reading things you enjoy makes you more motivated to understand them better, which creates a positive cycle. In short, use these guidelines only as long as they help you further your own goals and understand what you'd like to understand.

Are you interested in extensive reading now? Whatever you're into, from classic novels to science books to fanfiction, you can read what you’re excited about extensively to improve your skills and have fun doing it.

## Intensive Reading

_Best started:_ as a mid-to-advanced beginner, or as soon as you know enough grammar and vocabulary to understand simple paragraphs.

_Best material to use:_ any type of content at or around an i+1 level. I'll explain what that means in a moment.

Intensive reading is very different from extensive reading. Traditionally, it is instructor-led, and involves, as mentioned earlier, analysis up to and including translation of the target language content. This method is great for leading students towards full understanding of a given passage, but what should we do if we don't have a teacher of our target language available? It calls for a reworking of the concept.

Let's repeat the definition I came up with earlier:

**Intensive reading:** you'll look up each word you don't understand until you fully (or to the best of your current ability) understand each sentence of the material.

This is perhaps even simpler to explain than extensive reading. Once we've [chosen a text](#choosing-a-text) (the complicated part), our goal is to read through it, look up the words we don't know or don't understand in context, and puzzle out each sentence until we understand what it means. Ideally, we also want to record new vocabulary, such as in a notebook, by adding a flashcard, or however you currently practice vocabulary. And that's it! It's simple, though not necessarily easy.

But wait, how do you pick your text in the first place?

### Choosing a Text

To explain choosing a text for intensive reading, let me first explain the concept of i+1. I plan to do a post later on comprehensible input, the concept encompassing i+1, but the gist is that both are part of Stephen Krashen's work on second language acquisition, which posits (among other things) that a learner at stage "i" is able to acquire new information when input is at level "i+1". For our purposes, all this means is that the level of input should be only slightly above the level of total comprehension for a student to learn something.

Now, as you can imagine, finding texts or recordings at level i+1 for any given level is not easy to do. It is for this reason that I didn't even bring it up when discussing extensive reading—in that case, although we'd love to find i+1, the most important factor is our interest in the material. I bring it up now instead because _level is more important when doing intensive reading_; since we don't have a teacher or even necessarily a native speaker we can ask for help, we need to be able to figure out the text on our own.

This isn't to say i+1 is essential for success. With some effort and a good dictionary and/or grammar resource on hand, we could certainly puzzle out i+2 or 3, whatever that may mean to you. However, choosing material thoughtlessly will inevitably lead to selecting something too easy, meaning less progress, or too hard, meaning frustration.

_But you still haven't told me how to pick material!_ you might be thinking. That's because selection will be mostly dependent on your tolerance level. If you enjoy figuring out difficult sentences, you may be able to choose a hard text and simply work on it in short bursts. If you don't enjoy that quite as much, a hybrid approach between extensive and intensive reading may be the place you want to start.

That's the path I took initially: perhaps not the fastest, but the one most suited to my motivation at the time. With this method, you might ensure you figure out each sentence's meaning as completely as you can, but you may still choose something you like and you may or may not write down every new word. I can't say I recommend against this hybrid method—after all, it helped me—but I suspect it doesn't lead to progress as fast as doing full-on intensive reading, notes and all.

## Conclusion

Extensive and intensive reading are effective methods for learning, and if nothing else, they're a valuable tool for dividing up studying so you aren't using one method alone, which could lead to boredom and loss of motivation. Do you have to do things this way? Of course not, but know that as an intermediate learner, you want to move away from textbooks and into native material, perhaps before you feel ready to do so. Extensive and intensive reading are ways you can maintain structure in your study time while moving into material written by and for native speakers of your target language.
