_If you'll allow me to talk about myself for a few minutes..._

My interest in Japanese began in high school. Interestingly, I didn't watch much anime as a kid, and I didn't read manga as a preteen. As a teenager, though, I got into Vocaloid music. If you're not familiar with it, I'll place one of the most famous Vocaloid songs below.

An aside, if you're interested:

|What is Vocaloid?|
|--------|
|Vocaloid is a computer program that does what is called singing synthesis or voice synthesis (音声合成). It was created in the US, but didn't catch on until they tried marketing it in Japan with Japanese voicebanks, and put character art on the box. Now, one of the voicebanks/characters, [Hatsune Miku](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Hatsune_Miku), is referred to as things like "a virtual idol" by fans worldwide, and there are even Vocaloid concerts! One of the neat things about this program and subculture is that the characters and voicebanks, created by various companies, are usually licensed such that anyone can use them, at least for noncommercial purposes. I won't go into the legal details, but the gist is that you don't need special permission just to create a song (or artwork) with Hatsune Miku or another Vocaloid voicebank.|

But I digress. As I was saying, in high school, I got really into Vocaloid music, and loved watching music videos, though I didn't touch the fandom. Somewhere along the way, I became more and more curious about the Japanese language, and started researching how to learn it on my own, too impatient to wait for college.

I took a somewhat unusual approach: while teaching myself grammar through online guides, I "front-loaded" the Jouyou Kanji (常用漢字). In other words, I learned most if not all of the common-use kanji right at the beginning. I wouldn't recommend this approach for everyone, because it involved a lot of dedication, but personally I was able to ride the wave of enthusiasm for learning I had initially and get quite a lot of important knowledge under my belt early on.

I also began reading manga series just as soon as I was able to—the phrase "able to" being used very loosely here. Even when I had to look up five-plus words per page, I was able to get through several series and increase my reading skills dramatically.

After the first year or two, though, my pace slowed down significantly. I made it to college and took some classes in Japanese, and I continued to read extensively (in the sense of [extensive reading](/extensive-intensive-reading)), but I never studied with the same one-track mind I had at the start. 

I dabbled in other languages along the way (specifically Korean and Chinese), but I found myself unable to "repeat the miracle" of combined motivation, novelty, and extra time that I had when I began learning Japanese.

Now that I'm out of college and my only "studying" is through my timeline on Twitter (an exaggeration, but not by much), this blog is one way I'm attempting to hold myself accountable for continuing to learn and improve my Japanese language skills. 

By researching and writing articles about different language-learning techniques, it encourages me to use those techniques myself, and simply by thinking about studying Japanese more often, it will push me to take it more seriously as a hobby and a skill, and to continue moving forward.
