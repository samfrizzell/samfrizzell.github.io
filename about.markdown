# About Me

My name is Sam Frizzell and I'm a Japanese language enthusiast. I have a Bachelor's degree in Asian Studies and Asian Cultures & Languages (i.e. Japanese), but if I'm honest, I learned more Japanese on my own, through self-study, than I did through my degree.

I'm very passionate about the idea that with enough enthusiasm, time, and the right tools, you too can learn a language such as Japanese! _**Yes, you!**_ I'll be discussing Japanese mostly, as that's my experience, but the techniques I talk about can be applied to other languages as well.

Please take a few minutes to explore my blog, and you may just learn something new!

### About This Site

This site was made with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in order to prove to myself that I could learn technical skills on my own, and not just language skills. And if it looks impressive to someone else, too, well, that's a great bonus!

The theme used for this blog is [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk). If you're interested looking at my files, check out this site's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/samfrizzell/samfrizzell.github.io).
